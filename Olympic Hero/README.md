# Project: Olympic-Hero

The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Throughout this project, we will explore the Olympics dataset(scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table)) , look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.

### Why solve this project?
This project provides a better understanding of data handling with python(pandas). In this project, we'll be applying the following concepts:

 - Dataframe operations

 - Conditional statement and loops

 - List operations

 - Bar Plotting
 
 - Mathematical operations

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Olympic Hero/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Olympic_Hero.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Olympic_Hero.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
